        <li>Pour a small amount of batter into the skillet, using a ring mold if desired, and cook until bubbles form on the surface.</li>
        <li>Flip and cook the other side until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings.</li>
