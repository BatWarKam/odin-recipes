    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other recipes.</p>
    <p>There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found necessary, such as adding a dash of wine vinegar to the sauce and changing the amount of Parmesan cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef and cook until browned. Drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add diced onion, bell pepper, and minced garlic to the skillet. Sauté until vegetables are soft.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, oregano, parsley, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, wine vinegar, sugar, and salt. Simmer for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>While the sauce simmers, cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Layer noodles, sauce, and cheese (such as mozzarella and Parmesan). Repeat layers, finishing with sauce and cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes, until cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
